# Asterhythm
This is the repository for Asterhythm, started at SteelHacks 2016
### Where to go from here
 - **Echo Nest** Retrieve lists of genre suggestions, validate queries, store player preferences in accounts
 - **Echo Nest Remix** Use the *better* Python library (or hope the JS one improves) to play back music with special effects/remixing/fine-tuning
 - **Spotify** Maybe the libspotify SDK will be updated (or a successor will come), or maybe the Web API will let you control *how* you stream
 - **ChartLyrics** Can't do much more with the API itself, but imagine being able to create LRC files (timestamped lyrics) algorithmically...
 - **Houndify** Make a back-end that uses Houndify to make LRC files, or at least correctly identify parts of a song
